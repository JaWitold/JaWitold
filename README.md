I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Wrocław, Poland, with a passion for building scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems. With a strong foundation in the **PHP/Symfony** ecosystem, my true focus is on solid **system architecture**, migrating legacy systems to modern **microservice-based solutions**, and writing clean, maintainable code.

My professional experience is complemented by a deep academic background in computer science. I am currently pursuing a **Ph.D. in Applied Cryptography**, which provides me with a unique and security-first perspective on software engineering.
